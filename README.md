# Metadata Standard for Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)

This specification defines metadata fields and JSON-based format describing
Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data sets.

This specification is based on the work by the DAS Research Coordination Network (DAS-RSN)
and published in Lai et al. (2024).  This work is documented at:

## Documentation source organization

* The `draft` branch contains the latest draft documentation. All changes are first applied to
  this branch for review and merged with main for releases.
* Specification releases are tags in the form `v.#.#-d#`.

## Versioning

The versioning scheme used in tags uses the following form: `vMAJOR.MINOR-dDOC` where:
* `MAJOR.MINOR` are the version of the specification, and
* `DOC` is the version of the documentation.

The `MAJOR` version changes for breaking changes to the schema.

The `MINOR` version changes when backwards-compatible extensions have been made to a major
version.

The `DOC` version changes when the documentation has been updated with clarifications, typos,
etc. and does not imply any functional change to the specification.
